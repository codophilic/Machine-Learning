@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????,2
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.,2
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons,2
@united I wanna be grand staff,1
"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...",2
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate,2
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.,2
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.,2

@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.,2
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic,2

@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?,2
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections,2
"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?",2

@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL,2
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.,2
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?,2
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.,2
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.,2
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.,2
"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!",2

@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus,2
"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!",2
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?,2

@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united,2
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.,2
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.,2
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.,2

@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers,2
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether,2
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue,2
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG,2
"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break",2
"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!",1
@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.,2

@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...,2
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.,2
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.,2

@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.,2
"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS",2
"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?",2
@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.,2
@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa,1
@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired,2
@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.,0
@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.,2
@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK,2
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with,2
"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!",2
"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots",2
@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap,2
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!,2
@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.,0
@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please,2
@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth,2
@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded,2
@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.,2
@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids,2

@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?,2
@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?,2
"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?",2
@AmericanAir Close down,2
@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!,1
@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.,1
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.,2
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.,2
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it,2
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.,2
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone,2
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight,2
@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.,2
@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us,2
@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!,2

@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?,2
@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?,2
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!,2
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.,2
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.,2
@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?,2

"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins",2
